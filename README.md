Mine oxidations states for structures from the (MOF) subset of the CSD and calculate features for them. Runscripts are automatically installed for the most important steps.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Some parts of the code requires some modifications in the packages, for which I did not make PRs so far, you need to use my forks.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: For the minining of the oxidation states, you need the CSD python API and installed. You need also to install `CSD_HOME`. Due to the licensing issues, this cannot be done automatically.
