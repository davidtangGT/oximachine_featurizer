Mine oxidations states for structures from the (MOF) subset of the CSD and calculate features for them. Runscripts are automatically installed for the most important steps.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: Some parts of the code require some modifications in the dependencies, for which I did not make PRs so far. You need to use my forks. You need `pip>=18.1` for this to be set up automatically. More details can be found below.

> ⚠️ **Warning**: For the mining of the oxidation states, you need the CSD Python API.
You need to export the `CSD_HOME` path. Due to the licensing issues, this cannot be done automatically.
